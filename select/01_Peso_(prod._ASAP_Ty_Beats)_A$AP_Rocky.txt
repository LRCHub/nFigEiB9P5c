I be that pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell my niggas with the bitching, we gon' make it in a second
Never disrespected, plus I'm well connected
With this coke that I imported, just important as your president

Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7'
Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in

Blowing blunts, rolling doobies up, smoking section
Groupies rush, holding boobies up in my direction
Quit with all the fronting, you ain't round my click for nothing
'Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing

This is the way it go, this is the way we roll
'Cause, every day, we on our pesos, so
This is the way it go, this is the way we roll
'Cause, every day, we on our pesos, so

(Gun cock, gunshot gonna lick a boy)
(Gun cock, gunshot gonna lick a boy)
(Gun cock, gunshot gonna lick a boy)
'Cause, every day, we on our pesos

Your bitches said that I'm hot, man, I told her I agree
She going really think I'm hot if I told her my degrees
Pull up in that hard-top (vroom), showing off my keys
Grabbed by school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees

Couple A, B, C's, bad bitch, double D
Popping E, I don't give a F, told you I'm a G
ASAP, Stevie got it on his sleeve
But I got it on my chest, my nigga, this is what I breathe

Inhale, exhale, cocaine X pills
Import export, Harlem catching wrecks still (uh)
So, mami, show me how that neck feel
Later show me how the rest feel, for now just chill

This is the way it go, this is the way we roll
'Cause, every day, we on our pesos
This is the way it go, this is the way we roll
'Cause, every day, we on our pesos

(Gun cock, gunshot, gone a little boy)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gone a little boy)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gone a little boy)
'Cause, every day, we on our pesos

'Cause, every day, we on our pesos
